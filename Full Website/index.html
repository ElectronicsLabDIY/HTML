                     I’m Rahul and have a huge interest for Electronics and Computers.
                      I’m a self learner and adopted application oriented approach for this purpose.
                       I love to make things simple and like to explain to the people in much simpler way.
                        According to me, story telling is an art which makes new things interesting many a times.
                         I have completed my B. Tech from Uttar Pradesh Technical University, UP (INDIA) in Electronics
                          & Communication. To know technical things better, I completed M. Tech from National Institute of 
                          Technology (NIT) Silchar (INDIA) in VLSI (EC). To explore things deeper in this field, 
                          I joined the Department of EEE in  Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, INDIA as
                           a PhD candidate. Now, I’m exploring various things around Electronics & Computers to built
                            something useful.
                     <br><br>
I enjoy sports and athletic activities. I am a Marathon runner and till now I have completed, one 25K run,
 7 Half Marathons (21 KM), three 10K run and 5 IITG cross country run (7/6 KM) in various national and
  international level running events. I competed in Airtel Delhi Half Marathon and TATA Steel Kolkata 25K 
  which have international recognitions. I’m a meditation enthusiast and practising Heartulness meditation
   from last 8 years. I also play Badminton, TT, Lawn tennis and like to do long distance cycling as well.
    I’m attracted towards long distance motorcycle rides and explored north east India a lot during my various
     trips. My longest ride was more than 1100Km, Guwahati (Assam)  to Tawang (AR) (to and fro) in 5 days entirely 
     on hilly terrain

   Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) are elastic waves generated on free surface of solids. In engineering applications, 
   SAW can be created via electromechanical transduction using piezoelectric materials. SAW devices are used 
   in many applications such as: RF Filter, Touchscreen, MEMS sensor, Lab on chip device, fluid flow 
   measurement and basic electronic building blocks. These applications are limited by its fixed frequency 
   of operation. In this research, we are trying to make basic SAW device programmable by exploiting photoconductive 
   property and advanced optical projection techniques. This will be highly useful for IOT and 5G applications along 
   with the conventional need of SAW.
</h3>     
<h4>
   Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices find their applications in electronics elementary functional units (eg- delay lines), radios (mixer, oscillator etc), microfluidics, flow measurement and for designing various electronics blocks in the communication system (amplifier, filters etc). If we take an example of a mobile phone in
which we use bandpass filters just after the antenna and this bandpass filter is said
to be best if it is having high Q-factor. Such filters are called high Q-BPF and this
is achieved best using SAW devices. Some other areas and applications are also
there where SAW devices are the best candidate when it comes to performance.
The main problem with the SAW device is its fixed frequency characteristics.
This limitation is due to fixed IDT structures which are made using metal such
as Aluminium. When SAW waves are generated in SAW device, it is the pitch of
the electrode which decides the frequency along with the acoustic wave velocity of
material which is governed by two equations (i) f=v/ λ; where f, v and λ are the
frequency, acoustic velocity and wavelength respectively, and (ii) λ=2p; where p
is pitch of IDT (distance between two consecutive fingers of IDT). Similarly, filters
are also designed for a particular center frequency due to the above reason. Thus,
tuning of the filter is the major challenge with this device even though it got high Q
property. Therefore. on one hand, we are getting high Q from SAW device and on
the other hand, we are limited by tuning of frequency. Consequently, to materialize
its high Q, one should make this device programmable. Not only this example but
there are tons of application which can perform optimum if programmability can
be added with the SAW device.
If we talk about the solution then the solution to make it programmable can
be found out in the above-discussed equations. For frequency tuning the direction
to work it out maybe variable velocity or variable IDT pitch. To make a tunable
SAW device one needs to use techniques such as - biasing the substrate to change
velocity, exploiting photoconductive property for IDT implementation and external
programming of IDTs. Photoconductive property in SAW device is not much explored yet with recently discovered or best available photoconductive materials and
projection techniques. Using this technique with the advanced projection setup and
by choosing suitable photoconductive material, a fully programmable and tunable
SAW device can be achieved. The objective of this research is to explore various
possible ways to make SAW device programmable.
